## Issues

### Download Blocked by Browser (Fix for most browsers)
- Press the key combination CTRL + J or go to your downloads.
- It should take you to the downloads screen of your browser.
- From there click "Allow malicious file" or "Allow file" or "Accept the risk" or "Keep" or "Keep file", etc

But don't be scared Simple Executor V2 is completely safe. "But then why does my antivirus and browser say it is" you may ask.

### Antivirus blocking from download/running Simple Executor V2

Why this happens:

- Antiviruses usually mistake Roblox exploits as viruses due to their nature. Most if not all modern Roblox exploits work by injecting some sort of dll file into Roblox and running Lua code (Scripts) in the environment it creates.
- But heres the catch: Dll injection isnt just used by game cheats. They are also used by malware. Due to this antivirus try to quarantine/delete all dll injectors they detect without actually knowing what if they are safe or not. You will usually see antivirus calling most exploits including simple executor v2, krnl and etc a Cryptinject.msr trojan because of this.
- "But then how can you prove Simple Executor V2 isn't malware?" you might ask. User trust and safety is priority at Simple Executor V2, due to this the only hidden/protected part of the Simple Executor V2 client is the dll that is injected into Roblox (This being the dll files.)

To fix this issue you must uninstall any 3rd party antivirus from your system. Such as McAfee, Norton, Eset, Kaspersky etc. Sorry but there isnt another way of solving this issue. From my and many users experiences excluding/disabling 3rd party antivirus is terrible and doesnt yield consistent/reliable results.

After you have done that, Let's start the steps.
- Go to the virus and threat protection settings in Windows 10.
